# NN_Ground

Running NN_Viz in the command line will bring up a visualization of the Nearest Neighbor model of Ising spins. From here, you can change the dimensions of the model as well as which particular ground state is depicted. In the terminal, you can run NN_ground with command line arguments of height, width, initial seed, and number of seeds. It will return the ground states associated with each seed. The code is not yet working for seeds where the incremented variable is greater than zero, so it will not return ground states for these seeds.
